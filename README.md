# 🎮 Simon-Peter Game

**Simon-Peter** is a fast-paced memory game where you're challenged to remember and repeat a growing sequence of blinking colors. With each round, the pattern becomes longer and more intense. One wrong click? Start again.

> ⚠️ Note: This is **not** a "Simon Says" clone — it’s an original twist with its own name, style, and flow.
