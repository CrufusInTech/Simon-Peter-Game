Sure! Here’s the logic for adding a highscore section that tracks the highest level reached during a session (until the user refreshes):

1. *Initialize Highscore Variable:*
   Start with a variable (e.g., highscore) set to zero or the lowest possible level.

2. *Track Current Level:*
   As the user plays, keep track of their current level in another variable (e.g., currentLevel).

3. *Compare and Update:*
   Each time the user reaches a new level or finishes a level, compare currentLevel with highscore.

   * If currentLevel is greater than highscore, update highscore to currentLevel.

4. *Display Highscore:*
   Update the UI to display the current highscore so the user can see their best progress so far.

5. *Reset on Refresh:*
   Because the data is only stored in memory (variables), when the user refreshes the page, the highscore resets to zero and the tracking starts fresh.

### Summary:

* Keep a variable to store the highest level reached so far.
* Update it only if the current level exceeds it.
* Show it in the interface.
* The highscore resets when the page reloads because it’s not stored persistently.

If you want to save the highscore even after refresh, that would require persistent storage like cookies or localStorage. But for just during a session, the in-memory variable approach works perfectly.
